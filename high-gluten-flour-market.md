<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-gluten Flour Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Machine Milled Flour</li><li>Stone Ground Flour</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-gluten flour is available in two main market types: machine milled flour and stone ground flour. Machine milled flour is produced using industrial machinery that grinds the wheat into a fine powder, resulting in a consistent texture and higher gluten content. On the other hand, stone ground flour is made by grinding the wheat between two large stones, which retains more of the wheat germ and bran, resulting in a coarser texture and slightly lower gluten content. Both types of flour are popular choices for baking breads and other baked goods.</p></p>
