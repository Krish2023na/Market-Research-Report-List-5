<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chute Sampler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Chute Sampler</li><li>Sloped Gravity Chute Sampler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chute samplers are used in various industries to collect representative samples from a moving stream of material. There are two main types of chute samplers: gravity chute samplers and sloped gravity chute samplers. Gravity chute samplers are designed for vertical installations where material flows straight down through the sampler. Sloped gravity chute samplers, on the other hand, are installed at an angle to accommodate materials that may not free-fall vertically. Both types of chute samplers are essential in industries such as mining, agriculture, and food processing for accurate quality control and analysis.</p></p>
