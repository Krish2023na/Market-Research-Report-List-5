<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Millimeter Radio-Wave Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Scanner</li><li>Active Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Millimeter radio-wave scanners have two main market types: passive scanners and active scanners. Passive scanners do not emit any radio waves themselves but instead rely on detecting and analyzing radio waves that are naturally emitted by objects or individuals. Active scanners, on the other hand, emit radio waves themselves and then analyze the reflected waves to gather information about the object or individual being scanned. Both types of scanners are used for various applications such as security screening and industrial inspections.</p></p>
