<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HD Maps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crowdsourcing Model</li><li>Centralized Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HD Maps are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate efficiently and safely. The crowdsourcing model involves collecting data from various sources, including sensors on vehicles and user inputs, to continuously update and improve the maps. In contrast, the centralized model relies on a single entity to gather and update map data. While the crowdsourcing model harnesses the power of collective intelligence, the centralized model may offer more consistency and reliability in map information. Both models play a crucial role in advancing autonomous driving technology.</p></p>
