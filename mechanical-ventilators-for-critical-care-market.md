<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilators for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical ventilators are widely used in critical care settings to assist patients with breathing difficulties. There are two main types of ventilators: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require insertion of a tube into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen, while non-invasive ventilators do not require a tube to be inserted. Invasive ventilators are typically used for patients with severe respiratory issues or who are unconscious, while non-invasive ventilators are often used for patients with less severe breathing problems or for those who are conscious and able to breathe on their own to some extent.</p></p>
