<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Forging Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal Forging Machine Market includes two major types - Hot Forging and Cold Forging. Hot Forging involves heating the metal above its recrystallization temperature and then shaping it using high pressure, resulting in improved material properties. Cold Forging, on the other hand, involves shaping the metal at or below room temperature without heating it, resulting in increased strength and surface finish. Both methods have their own advantages and are widely used in various industries for producing high-quality forged components.</p></p>
