<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Radiator Fan</li><li>Electric Radiator Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle cooling fans are essential components in maintaining the optimal temperature of a vehicle's engine. Mechanical radiator fans are belt-driven and operate at the speed of the engine, while electric radiator fans are driven by an electric motor and can be controlled independently. Both types serve the same purpose of dissipating heat generated by the engine. Mechanical radiator fans are commonly found in older vehicles, while electric radiator fans are more common in modern vehicles due to their efficiency and ability to be controlled more precisely.</p></p>
