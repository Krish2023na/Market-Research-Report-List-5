<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipe Bevelers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Diameter (ID) Mount</li><li>Outside Diameter (OD) Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pipe bevelers come in two main types based on their mounting capabilities: Inside Diameter (ID) Mount and Outside Diameter (OD) Mount. ID Mount bevelers are designed to be mounted inside the pipe, making them ideal for smaller pipes or pipes with restricted access. OD Mount bevelers, on the other hand, are mounted on the outside of the pipe and are typically used for larger pipes or pipes with easier accessibility. Both types of bevelers serve the same purpose of creating beveled edges on pipes for welding and joining purposes.</p></p>
