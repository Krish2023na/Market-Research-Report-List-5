<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Soft Starts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Couplings</li><li>Flexidyne Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical soft starts are devices used to gradually ramp up the speed of rotating equipment, reducing stress and wear on the machinery. Two common types of mechanical soft start devices are Fluid Couplings and Flexidyne Couplings. Fluid couplings use hydraulic fluid to smoothly transmit power and gradually increase speed, ideal for applications where shock loads need to be minimized. Flexidyne couplings use a mechanical energy storage system to provide smooth acceleration and deceleration, making them perfect for applications requiring precise control over speed changes.</p></p>
