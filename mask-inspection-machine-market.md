<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mask Inspection Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Die to Die (DD) Method</li><li>Die to Database (DB) Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mask Inspection Machine market includes two main types: Die to Die (DD) Method and Die to Database (DB) Method. In Die to Die (DD) Method, the machine compares the mask being inspected to a reference mask directly, evaluating any differences in patterns. On the other hand, Die to Database (DB) Method compares the mask to a pre-existing database of patterns, enabling faster and more efficient inspection. Both methods play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and quality of masks used in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
