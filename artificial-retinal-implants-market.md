<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial retinal implants are devices designed to restore vision in individuals with retinal degenerative diseases. There are two main types of retinal implants: Epiretinal implants, which are placed on top of the retina, and Subretinal implants, which are placed underneath the retina. Epiretinal implants work by stimulating the remaining retinal cells to create visual signals, while Subretinal implants directly stimulate the remaining retinal cells to generate visual information. Both types aim to improve vision and quality of life for those with retinal disorders.</p></p>
