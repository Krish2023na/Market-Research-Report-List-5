<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Toughening Agent for Epoxy Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rubber Toughening Agent</li><li>Thermoplastic Resin Toughening Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active toughening agents for epoxy resin play a vital role in improving the mechanical properties of epoxy resin-based materials. There are two main types of toughening agents: rubber toughening agents and thermoplastic resin toughening agents. Rubber toughening agents consist of rubber particles dispersed in the epoxy matrix, providing impact resistance and flexibility. On the other hand, thermoplastic resin toughening agents enhance the toughness of epoxy resin by forming a secondary phase that absorbs energy during deformation, improving the overall strength and durability of the material.</p></p>
